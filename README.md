# PythonExercises
This Repository is for all the projects that I come across or things that I can do on my way to becoming a Python Developer.
Any project, no matter how big or small, I will be putting in here with the goal of pushing something to the folder everyday.
Please feel free to critic my code, fork my files and suggest new features if you wold like. I definitely could use all the help I can get.
